# EmpiricalBirthdayProblem ![CI status](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen.svg)

A program that empirically tests the [birthday problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem).

## Dependencies
* Python 3
* [MatPlotLib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib)
* [numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy)

## Usage
The program generates a number of graphs as tests are run and saves them as .png files. The series of images can be used to create a gif.
For instance:

![alt-text](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/358041277603905538/500048161600045059/birthdayproblem.gif "5000 tests run")

The total number of tests run, the max number of people tested, and the number of graphs generated are all easily modifiable.
